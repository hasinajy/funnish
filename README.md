# Funnish

**The coding playground's project stash!** Purely for hands-on learning; the focus is on having fun mastering the building blocks. This repository is a space to get hands-on with new programming languages and explore technologies through bite-sized projects. Each mini-project is designed to be a little adventure, showcasing unique features and providing a tangible learning experience.

## Structure

Think of this as a well-organized toybox! The repository is structured by programming language. Inside each language's directory, you'll find one or more projects ready for you to explore. Feel free to dive in, tinker, modify, and contribute your own creations to the stash!

## Contributing

1.  Fork the repository – grab your copy of the toybox!
2.  Create a new branch for your brilliant addition.
3.  Add your project under the appropriate language directory or create a new section for a new language.
